Really it doesnt do anything. Just a webserver with some tekst... used for testing..this time with nodejs

a simple webserver. Needed:
- npm install express
- https dont have to do anything
- npm install body-parser

run it with node app.js
make sure node is installed, ex npm:"npm install -g npm@latest".

go to localhost:3000
